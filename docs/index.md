## Summary

The main purpose of this app will be to allow a user access to a permanent collection of an art museum.  
Once persistent data has been submitted by the User, said museum would share images made from the User.

    The user will send a text request to the museum who will in turn send an image to the user from their database.

## Intended users

    People who enjoy going to the museum to see art in person.
  
* Art researchers
    A person who seeks inspiration in creating new artworks, either visually or through the written word.
  
* Art teachers
    Lessons could be planned around various techniques used and materials used by the artist.

## Stretch goals/possible enhancements 

TBD
If you can identify functional elements of the software that you think might not be achievable in the scope of the project, but which would nonetheless add significant value if you were able to include them, list them here. For now, we recommend listing them in order of complexity/amount of work, from the least to the most.
* Layering on the pages as needed
* specific permissions from local art museums
